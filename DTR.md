## DTR

Project: Stretch-Auth

Group Member Names: Ben, Horacio, Naomi & Jordy

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
* Work well with React and learn how to implement OAuth.
* Learning a new skill and refining current skills is the priority
* Improve self teaching skills
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
* Emphasis on learning.
* Mixture of Driver/Navigator & Drive/Conquer
* Try to explain what code you're writing out loud when doing Driver/Navigator

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
* We're all open to constructive criticism and willing to reach out for help
* Strong collaborative workflow via git project board

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
* Hard cutoff for group work is 9:00pm
* Respect members having time off on weekends.
  * Ben no Sundays
* Long dinner breaks!
* Avoid late nights

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
* Scheduled stand ups w/ group before signing up!
* Constant slack communication
* Post lunch meet ups via zoom

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
* Reinforce React & React Testing
* Learn OAauth!
* If we successfully get OAuth working that is an absolute win!

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* Make sure you are contributing
* Make sure everyone gets to contribute
* If you do a lot of solo work, the expectation is you take the time to catch the group up on the independent work

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 
* PR template
  * Try to have issue for new feature (basically bullet points in iterations)
  * Try to have all group members review PR's, min should be 2. 
    * Submitter does not merge PR
Pomodoro Break Schedule:
* 50/10
* Natural breaks
* Respect when someone just needs a break

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Additional Remote Considerations:
